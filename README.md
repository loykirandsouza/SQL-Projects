# SQL Projects

## Overview

This repository contains SQL scripts that demonstrate various SQL concepts such as data manipulation, joins, key constraints, and introductory SQL commands. Each file is designed to showcase a specific aspect of SQL programming.

## File Descriptions

1. **start.sql**

   - This file serves as the introductory script, setting up the environment and creating initial tables and datasets.

2. **intro.sql**

   - This script contains basic SQL commands, including table creation, data insertion, and simple queries.

3. **DML.sql**

   - This script covers Data Manipulation Language (DML) operations such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `SELECT` statements, demonstrating how to manipulate and retrieve data from tables.

4. **joins.sql**

   - This file demonstrates different types of SQL joins, including `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN`, showing how to combine data from multiple tables.

5. **key constraints.sql**

   - This script focuses on key constraints such as `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `UNIQUE`, and `CHECK`, illustrating how to enforce data integrity and relationships between tables.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have a SQL database management system (DBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server installed.
2. Open your SQL editor and connect to your database.
3. Run the scripts in the recommended order:
   - `start.sql`
   - `intro.sql`
   - `DML.sql`
   - `joins.sql`
   - `key constraints.sql`

## Requirements

- SQL DBMS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server)
- SQL Editor (e.g., MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, or SQL Server Management Studio)
